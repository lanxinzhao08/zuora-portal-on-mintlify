# Quickstart API changelog


From Zuora Release 2022.09.R1, the Quickstart API is available to customers with the Orders (or Order Harmonization) and Invoice Settlement features enabled. The Quickstart API allows new integrators to swiftly integrate with Zuora, and it supports essential business use cases.

This changelog outlines the latest API updates and resolved issues to the Quickstart API, and documentation updates to the [Quickstart API Reference](/other-api/quickstart-api/). We would love to hear your feedback on how we can improve it. If you have any comments on the Changelog for the Quickstart API, please send an e-mail to [docs@zuora.com](mailto:docs@zuora.com).

### Resolved issues

This section lists the issues that have been resolved as of April 22, 2024.

We have resolved the following issues:

- Only 3 price tiers was returned in the response of the [Retrieving a price](/other-api/quickstart-api/prices/getprice) operation if the price contains more than 3 price tiers. Now it will return all tiers in this case.

- When [listing products](/other-api/quickstart-api/products/getproducts) with the exact match (`EQ`) filtering condition on the `name` field, no matching results were returned if the product name contained leading or trailing white spaces or other special characters. Now these products are correctly returned.

- When [retrieving a subscription](/other-api/quickstart-api/subscriptions/getsubscriptionbykey), `subscription_plans` > `subscription_plan_number` was not returned as expected. This issue has been resolved and `subscription_plan_number` is returned as part of the Subscription Plan object.

- If you did not specify a specific date when trying to downgrade a subscription plan using [Update a subscription](/other-api/quickstart-api/subscriptions/patchsubscription), the date for the new plan was incorrectly set by the system. This issue has been resolved and the date would be automatically set to the end of the billing period as designed.

- When filtering payment methods with a specific state using the [List payment methods](/other-api/quickstart-api/payment-methods/getpaymentmethods) operation, un expected error occurred. This issue has been resolved and the correct collection of payment methods is returned for this case.

- When [creating a price](/other-api/quickstart-api/prices/createprice) with a payload that doesn't contain the `unit_amounts`, `amounts`, or `tiers` field, an error occurred indicating that these mutually exclusive fields were provided.

- When attempting to use the default payment gateway for an account by setting `payment_gateway` to `null` in the [Update an account](/other-api/quickstart-api/accounts/updateaccount) payload, you would run into an `invalid_parameter` error. This issue has been resolved and you can set `payment_gateway` to `null` to use the default payment gateway.


### Doc updates

This section lists the documentation updates that were made in this version of the API Reference.

- In the response of [List credit memo items](/other-api/quickstart-api/credit-memos/getcreditmemoitems) operation, updated the `credit_memo` field as expandable. This field is returned only if you specify the `expand[]=credit_memo` query parameter.

- In the response of [List debit memo items](/other-api/quickstart-api/debit-memos/getdebitmemoitems) operation, updated the `debit_memo` field as expandable. This field is returned only if you specify the `expand[]=debit_memo` query parameter.

We have resolved the following issue:

- Previously, when using the `page_size` query parameter to retrieve the list of subscriptions for the "List orders" operation, not all results were returned. We have resolved this issue by unapplying the `page_size` parameter for this case.

- When filtering results by `end_date` on the Product object, you might encounter the issue where the results were returned as if you were filtering on `start_date`. This issue has been resolved. In addition, we have enhanced our error handling mechanism for the `filter[]` query paramter. An error will be thrown with details about which filter parameters need to be edited.

On the contrary, setting it to `false` resulted that the zero-amount invoices were sent. This issue has been resolved and the behaviors for setting it to `true` and `false` are inverted.
