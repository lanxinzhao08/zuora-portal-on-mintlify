title: "Idempotent requests"
---
The Zuora API supports idempotency that prevents the same operation from
being performed multiple times by accident. For example, when you attempt
to create a product using the [Create a
product](/other-api/quickstart-api/products/createproduct)
operation but no response is returned because of the network issue, you
can retry the request using the same idempotency key to ensure that only
one product is created.
&nbsp;
To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `idempotency-key`
header in the request. This idempotency key should be a unique value and
the Zuora server identifies subsequent retries of the same request using
this value. The value should be less than 255 characters long.
&nbsp;
When you submit a request with the `idempotency-key` specified, the
resulting status code, headers, and the body of this request is saved
regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Subsequent requests with the
same key return the same result. A created idempotency key is
automatically removed from the system 24 hours after it is set.
&nbsp;
All `POST` and `PATCH` requests accept idempotency keys. Because the
`OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests are intrinsically
idempotent, you should not specify the `idempotency-key` header in these
requests.
&nbsp;
Note that the following HTTP status codes are specific to using the
`idempotency-key` header:

- **409 Conflict**: Usually caused by submitting concurrent requests for
the same cached data while the request is still in progress.

- **422 Unprocessable Content**: Usually caused by a mismatch of tenant
IDs, URLs or HTTP methods.
