title: "OAuth on Android using the Public API"
---
This guide is for an app developer who needs to integrate with Zephr’s OAuth social sign-in.

## Prerequisites

Configure the OAuth client ID and secret for the providers you are using, details on how to can be found on the [OAuth 2.0 page](https://docs.zuora.com/en/zephr/quickstart/introduction-to-zephr "OAuth 2.0").

Add the Android redirect URI to your Zephr Site (UI for this pending).

This should be either:

*   An app-claimed https URL redirection e.g. [https://myapp.com/oauthredirect](https://myapp.com/oauthredirect)
*   A custom URL scheme e.g. `app://myappname/oauthredirect`

Add the Zephr OAuth callback address to your OAuth providers allowed redirects list.
`GET https://mysite.com/blaize/oauth/<provider>/android/callback`

The documentation for the Zephr Public API can be found on the Zephr Support Site.

## Implementation

Start the OAuth flow by opening a custom chrome tab with the following Public API call:
`GET https://mysite.com/blaize/oauth/<provider>?client_type=android`

This will redirect the browser to the provider’s OAuth page for the user to authenticate, and will redirect back to the Zephr OAuth callback endpoint upon completion.

A list of providers and how to configure them can be found on the [OAuth with the Public API](/zephr-docs/zephr-api/zephr-api-tutorials/on-site-oauth-with-the-public-api/ "On-site OAuth with the Public API") page.

There are 3 possible outcomes from the OAuth flow callback:

*   Login successful
*   Partial Registration
*   Failure

### Login successful

If the user either already exists in the Zephr User store or if there are no required registration fields, a user will be successfully logged in and a Zephr session ID will be returned.

Example response:
`<redirecturi>?action=login&status=success&tracking_id=1234&session_id=1234`

### Partial Registration

If the user accepts the authentication request but Zephr does not have all the information to create the account in the Zephr User store, a partial registration will return a state key that can be used to fully register a user with the missing registration fields.

Example response:
`<redirecturi>?action=register&status=partial&state_key=1234&identifier=user@example.com`

Using the state\_key returned by the callback, the required fields can be sent to fully register a user.

```
POST https://mysite.com/blaize/register
{
    "validators": {
        "token\_exchange": "<state\_key>"
    },
    "attributes": {
        "first-name": "Example",
        ...
    }
}
```

### Failure

The user denied the authentication request or something went wrong.

Example response:
`<redirecturi>?action=login&status=failure&message=...`

An example login Android project is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/blaizeinc/zephr-android-oauth-example) for reference.
